I lost my heart among the waves;
I wait to feel it sink.
The girl I love has gone to sea,
Whilst I stand on the brink.
To my dismay she gives her ship,
More love than ever I got.
And I am left on the shore,
For my love's become a pi-rot.

When first I heard, I was on board,
It's quite a sexy look.
The hat looks good, and I was pleased
That neither hand was a hook
The eyepatch was a turn on,
Even the sword I thought quite hot.
The peg leg may have been a touch too much
When my love became a pi-rot.

For half a moon we sailed the seas,
And other vessles sank.
Though my cohorts did mutiny,
But I bid them walk the plank.
But now our midship has been scuppered,
Our love succumbed to dry rot.
I am left to stay the course,
For my love's become a pi-rot

I wait to hear her crows nest call,
And spy me off the bow.
Ignore the sirens calling that,
She lies in the locker now.
So I stand alone, upon the bay,
And cannot help but cry lots.
It's a land lubbers life to curse the day,
My love became a pi-rot.
